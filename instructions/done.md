# The classic paper airplane

## Introduction

The classic paper airplane has been around for a long time and each year **millions** are being folded and crashed into walls. 
Generally considered a product of Ancient China, paper airplanes have been used by [Da Vinci][1] and the [Wright brothers][2] alike. 
They all used paper airplanes to gain knowledge about aerodynamics. 

## How to fold the classic airplane

1. Take a sheet of notebook paper
2. Fold the page in the middle, parallel to the shorter sides
3. Unfold the page
4. Fold two corners along the same longer side into the middle line
5. Refold the page along the middle line created in step 2
6. Fold the outside parallel to the longer side of the plane, until about thumb thickness from the edge
7. Repeat step 6 on the other side
8. Unfold wings from steps 6 & 7 so that they are in a 90 degree angle to the rest of the plane
