The classic paper airplane <!-- H1 headline -->

Introduction <!-- H2 headline -->

The classic paper airplane has been around for a long time and each year millions are being folded and crashed into walls. 
<!-- Make millions bold face -->
Generally considered a product of Ancient China, paper airplanes have been used by Da Vinci and the Wright brothers alike. 
They all used paper airplanes to gain knowledge about aerodynamics. 
<!-- Create reference links to Da Vinci's and the Wright brothers' Wikipedia pages -->

How to fold the classic airplane <!-- H2 headline -->

<!-- This is going to be an ordered list -->
Take a sheet of notebook paper
Fold the page in the middle, parallel to the shorter sides
Unfold the page
Fold two corners along the same longer side into the middle line
Refold the page along the middle line created in step 2
Fold the outside parallel to the longer side of the plane, until about thumb thickness from the edge
Repeat step 6 on the other side
Unfold wings from steps 6 & 7 so that they are in a 90 degree angle to the rest of the plane
